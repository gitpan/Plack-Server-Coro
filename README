NAME
    Plack::Server::Coro - Coro cooperative multithread web server

SYNOPSIS
      plackup --server Coro

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Coro based Plack web server. It uses Net::Server::Coro under
    the hood, which means we have coroutines (threads) for each socket,
    active connections and a main loop.

    Because it's Coro based your web application can actually block with I/O
    wait as long as it yields when being blocked, to the other coroutine
    either explicitly with "cede" or automatically (via Coro::* magic).

      # your web application
      use Coro::LWP;
      my $content = LWP::Simple:;get($url); # this yields to other threads when IO blocks

    This server also uses Coro::AIO (and IO::AIO) if available, to send the
    static filehandle using sendfile(2).

    The simple benchmark shows this server gives 2000 requests per second in
    the simple Hello World app, and 300 requests to serve 2MB photo files
    when used with AIO modules. Brilliantly fast.

    This web server sets "psgi.multithread" env var on.
